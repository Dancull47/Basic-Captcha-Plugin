# Basic Captcha Plugin (Tested on 1.16.5)

This plugin is used to prevent new players from talking in Chat until they enter in the Captcha.  
You can customize the: Length of Captcha, Permission to bypass Captcha, Captcha Method, and much more.  
This is my first Minecraft Plugin I've made while learning Java and how to create a Plugin. It's simple, but I don't think it's poorly coded.  
I also had help from [seyfahni](https://github.com/seyfahni) who gave me suggestions and helped me improve the plugin!  

## Prerequisites

* [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) **MANDITORY**
* [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/) or any other plugin which handles Permissions. [Essentials](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/) is also popular, but I use LuckPerms
